# Overhead
A discord bot in Python using the Pycord API Wrapper. Focuses on a ticket system, manual verification, and staff applications via modals.

If you're interested in running this bot, you'll need a MongoDB Cluster, Join/Leave Log Webhooks, and the proper collections for MongoDB.\
All troubleshooting is up to you, no support will be provided.
