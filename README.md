# Overhead
A discord bot in Python using the Pycord API Wrapper. Focuses on a ticket system, manual verification, and staff applications via modals.

### Setup
If you're interested in running this bot, you'll need a MongoDB Cluster, Join/Leave Log Webhooks, and the proper collections for MongoDB.\
All troubleshooting is up to you, no support will be provided.

Also, keep in mind that some commands, functions, etc, have hardcoded elements, and it will be your job to alter these changes.
